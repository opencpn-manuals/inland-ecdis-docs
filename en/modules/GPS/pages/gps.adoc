= Adding a GPS Device

Many different GPS devices can be used to provide OpenCPN with the boat's position. For simplicity the Globalsat BU-353S4 GPS is used to demonstrate installing and using a GPS with OpenCPN

Other GPS devices that are available are listed https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:supplementary_hardware:gps_devices[HERE].

The GPS needs line of sight with satellites. You may need to move the GPS until it has a clear view of the sky. On a boat you could find that sufficient signal is received through a fibreglass deck.

== Device Drivers

Device drivers for various OS can be downloaded https://www.globalsat.com.tw/en/a4-10593/BU-353S4.html[HERE] 

== Windows

Download the installer for the version of Windows you are running.

Install the driver using the installer .exe.

Plug in the GPS. Windows should recognise the device and use the appropriate driver for it.
