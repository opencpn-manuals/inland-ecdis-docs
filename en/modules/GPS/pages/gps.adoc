= Adding a GNSS Device

There are a variety of GNSS devices that can provide OpenCPN with position data. We use "GNSS" here instead of "GPS" because today the receivers usually use several constellations. Besides GPS, for example, Galileo, GLONASS or Beidou. For simplicity the Globalsat BU-353S4 GPS is used to demonstrate installing and using a GPS with OpenCPN

Other GNSS devices that are available are listed https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:supplementary_hardware:gps_devices[HERE].

It is possible to use an existing ship's GNSS receiver interfaced with a serial-to-USB adapter.

The GNSS needs line of sight with satellites. You may need to move the GNSS until it has a clear view of the sky. On a boat you could find that sufficient signal is received through a fibreglass deck.

== Device Drivers

Device drivers for various OS can be downloaded https://www.globalsat.com.tw/en/a4-10593/BU-353S4.html[HERE] 

== Windows

Download the installer for the version of Windows you are running.

Install the driver using the installer .exe.

Plug in the GNSS. Windows should recognise the device and use the appropriate driver for it.

Scroll up and tick the *Show NMEA Debug Window*. This is not strictly necessary but gives a good indication of whether the GNSS is functioning correctly.

btn:[Apply] btn:[OK]

You may need to move the chart a litle but the ship's position appears.

The NMEA Debug Window can be closed with the *Close* image:3.6.jpg[] button.

The *Compass/GPS Status Window* shows a green bar image:3.7.jpg[] which indicates the strength of the GNSS signal.

The *Status Bar* shows the ship's position.

Zooming in image:3.8.jpg[] the icon for the ship changes to a boat outline image:3.9.jpg[]. The mouse scroll button can also be used to zoom in/out.

== MacOS

Plug in the GNSS.

The *Compass/GNSS Status Window* shows a green bar image:3.7.jpg[] which indicates the strength of the GNSS signal.

The *Status Bar* shows the ship's position.

== Linux

btn:[Options] btn:[Connections]

btn:[Add connection]

Using the serial connection the DataPort dropdown has an entry */dev/ttyUSB0-Prolific ...*.

btn:[Apply] and then tick *Enable* for this connection.

This presents a message about permissions.

btn:[OK]

Follow the advice for restarting OpenCPN.

A rule (symlink) has been created for using the GNSS advice.

image:3.13.jpg[]

If you need to remove the GNSS and clean up the installation the symlink can be removed using *Terminal*.

image:3.14.jpg[]

After restarting OpenCPN and editing the *DataPort* connection to use the symlink *opencpn0* the ship's position appears on the map.

Zoom in image:3.8.jpg[] and the boat icon image:3.9.jpg[] appears.
