Basic AIS receiver

[IMPORTANT]
.*OpenCPN AIS Settings*
====
To achieve the best performance and avoid cluttering the screen the AIS Target settings need adjusting. This will help in reducing the number of irrelevant alarms.

== Connecting the AIS

An AIS receiver may be connected in the same way as the GPS. The typical AIS data rate is 38400, instead of 4800.
However the easy way is get yourself a "AIS Pilotplug to USB" cable. This will also give you a GPS position (No need for a seperate GPS)

|AIS_Icon |Information |AIS_Icon |Information
|image:sart4.png[image,width=52,height=48] |An active AIS
SART and is a *distress* call equal to a **“Mayday”**transmission. More
about AIS link:ais/sart.html[sart].
|image:classb.png[image,width=45,height=59].. |The V-shape
stern indicates a Class B target. Tugboats and pilot boats very often
carry Class B transponders. These are often designed specifically for
small commercial boats, fishing boats and pleasure crafts.

when *testing* an AIS-SART device.

with the Euro http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/ais.html[AIS]
Inland specification.

|image:inland-blue.png[image,width=45,height=44] |This
vessel has the “Inland Blue Flag” set, it's a part of the European,
Inland AIS standard. The “Blue Flag” signal, commonly seen on inland
waters, indicates that the vessel requests a “stbd-stbd” passage or
crossing. This Blue Signal is manually switched on/off, by the target.

|image:ais-red.png[image,width=51,height=51] |Potential
Danger. |image:aton_std.png[image,width=45,height=46]
|Aton, Aid to Navigation, for example a Lighthouse or a Buoy with an AIS
transmitter.

|image:ais-yellow.png[image,width=51,height=51] |No Danger.
Not Identified (Voyage data not received)
|image:aton_off.png[image,width=45,height=44] |Aton, Aid to
Navigation, that is off it's suposed position. For example a buoy
equiped with AIS that has come adrift.

|image:ais-lemon.png[image,width=47,height=47] |No Danger.
Not Identified (Name from cached data)
|image:vaton.png[image,width=45,height=46] |Virtual Aton,
Virtual Aid to Navigation, not a real marker. Can be useful for a range
of situations. A new wreck, is one example.

user config error. (Old style display.)

by this ship. Note the black line on the yellow circle. This indicates
that the vessel is turning to port (left), also illustrated by the lag
in the display update. ROT - Rate Of Turn is available in the “Ais

== AIS Examples

image:9.9.jpg[]

A vessel at the junction appears to be altering course to enter 'our' canal.

*__right-click__*

image:9.10.jpg[]

The vessel is identified.

image:9.11.jpg[]

'Zeldenrust' is a potential danger and has triggered a warning based on the settings entered in OpenCPN.

COG predictor arrow length is set at three minutes. 

There is a red dashed extension line of the COG predictor which helps provide an estimate of time to CPA, if _target query_ has not been used. 

Estimated positions of the vessels at CPA are shown by the blue dots. 

The yellow highlighted line indicates the distance off at CPA.

image:9.14.jpg[]

'Zeldenrust' has turned further and will now pass down our port side. CPA 48.5m.

image:9.15.jpg[]

image:9.17.jpg[]

'Zeldenrust' is past and clear.

The vessel at 'Neptune Repair' is a potential danger but she is moored.
